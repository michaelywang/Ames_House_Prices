# Ames_House_Prices
Summary: Using Machine Learning models to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa

Predicted housing prices in Ames, Iowa based on historical data. Built a Python pre-processing module to clean and merge data in preparation for model testing, expanded upon given features to practice feature engineering with external market forces (VIX, CPI) to improve prediction accuracy. Used cross validation techniques to tune hyperparameters and compared our penalized regression models (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net) for the best result.
